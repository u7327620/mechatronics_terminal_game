# mechatronics_terminal_game

This is for my year 11 mechatronics class. Really just using the repo to look through and visualise the design process over time. 
Should you wish to re-create the project.

To use the code it requires an arduino with a button input on port 3 and 4. The arduino needs to be running
standard firmata from the arduino ide sketch library. Make sure to update the path variable to that of your arduino.

The game should work cross platform as long as the os.environ variable is changed to the operating system of choice
